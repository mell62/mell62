### Hello there! 👋

👨‍ I'm Mridhul, I'm currently a fourth year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering. 

🎮 I recently discovered an interest in **Front End Web Development** and I enjoy learning and building web development projects whenever I have free time from college activities. I really enjoy coding as well.


🗃️ Outside learning, I also enjoy doing workouts everyday and listening to music. I also know a bit of guitar and I enjoy challenging my friends to a game of Chess.
