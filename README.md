# Hey!

üë®‚Äçüéì I'm Mridhul, I'm a fresh Computer Science & Engineering graduate.

üïÆ I really enjoy coding. I recently discovered an interest in **Front End Web Development** and I enjoy learning and building web development projects whenever I have free time from college activities. 


üéÆ Outside learning, I also enjoy doing workout everyday and listening to music. I also know a bit of guitar and I enjoy challenging my friends to a game of Chess.
