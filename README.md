# Hey there! 👋

👨‍🎓 I'm Mridhul, I'm currently a fourth year student pursuing bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

🕮 I really enjoy coding. I recently discovered an interest in **Front End Web Development** and I enjoy learning and building web development projects whenever I have free time from college activities. 


🎮 Outside learning, I also enjoy doing workout everyday and listening to music. I also know a bit of guitar and I enjoy challenging my friends to a game of Chess.
